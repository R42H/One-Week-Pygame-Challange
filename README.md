# One-Week-Pygame-Challange - (@lifeisoverrated
I was bet that I couldnt learn the Pygame Module and create a 100lvl randomly generated platform game. After mistakenly forgetting and leaving it till the last three days, this was created. It shall be updated at a more normal pace from now on, to make a realy good game.

(Update) The original code has been added. The code has one major bug, being that you can still jump through the bottom of platfoms. Next update should include this being fixed , a moving finishing flag and possibly more platforms.
